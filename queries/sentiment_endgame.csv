I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.  If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world.  Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised.  But come on... Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part.  I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all.  But that’s the hero gig, right?  Part of the journey is the end. What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to. I love you 3000.",Avengers: Endgame,0.9865

You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her.  She’s very practical.  And only a tiny bit sadistic.  The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge.  Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.  Problem is that was about...49 hours ago.  Which means, we’re dead in the water.  A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago. Pep, I know I said no more surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one.  But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes.

978,THANOS,"You could not live with your own failure.  And where did that bring you?  Right back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive.

They will resist. ",Avengers: Endgame,-0.3818
979,THOR,That’s a little harsh-,Avengers: Endgame,-0.3832

Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. It was supposed to be me.  She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

Most of us are going back to places we know.  That doesn’t mean we know what to expect.  Be careful.  Look out for each other.  Improvise, if you have to. This is the fight of our lives.
