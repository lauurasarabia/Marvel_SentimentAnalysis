I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.  If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world.  Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised.  But come on... Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part.  I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all.  But that’s the hero gig, right?  Part of the journey is the end. What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to. I love you 3000.",Avengers: Endgame,0.9865
