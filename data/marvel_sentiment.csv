15,NARRATOR,"December 7, 1941: the day the world changed forever. President Roosevelt declares the United States will build fifty thousand planes to fight the armies of Hirohito and Hitler-- Although no such capacity to build existed... Howard Stark, founder of the fledgling Stark Industries, answers his call to duty -- And builds not fifty, but a hundred thousand planes. Later, Stark’s work on the Manhattan project makes the end of the war possible. Stark Industries would go on to contribute to every major weapons system through the Cold War -- But Howard Stark’s greatest achievement would come in 1973-- From early on, it was clear that Tony Stark had a unique gift-- At seventeen he graduated summa cum laude from MIT.  Four years later, tragedy would pass the Stark mantle from father to son-- The loss of a titan.  But Tony did not let personal grief distract him from his duty -- At twenty-one, he became the youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  And with it came a new mandate -- Smarter weapons, fewer casualties. A dedication to preserving life. Today Tony Stark’s ingenuity continues to protect freedom and American interest around the globe.",Iron Man,2008,197,0.142,0.723,0.134,-0.2283

467,TV REPORTER’S VOICE,"-- the ten mile drive to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into Hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness.  Simple farmers and herders, from peaceful villages, driven from their homes at the butt of Western rifles and the turrets of modern tanks.  Displaced from their lands by Warlords and insurgent groups emboldened by their newfound power -- a power fueled by high-tech weapons easily purchased with Poppy money on the black market -- and further destabilizing a fragile region which for decades has been a tinderbox of tribal feuding and ethnic hatred -- The villagers have taken shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find -- in the ruins of other razed villages, in the cold barren scrublands, or in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.  Our translator relayed to us one human tragedy after another.  A seven year old boy, thin as a scarecrow, clutching yellowed photographs and holding them out to anyone who would stop, with a child’s simple question: where are my mother and father?  A woman, begging for news of her husband, who’d been kidnapped by insurgents -- either forced to join their militia, or to be shot without reason -- With no political will or international pressure, there is little hope for these newly-formed refugees.

Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man.

They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them.
